After we did [our preparations]({{< ref "/posts/iceland-2018-preparation" >}}), the tour from Thorsmörk via Maelifell, Holmsarlon, Eldgja, Langisjor to Landmannalaugar was ready to start.

# Day 1: Hamburg → Reykjavik
{{< smallDate "2018-07-18" >}}
At the day before the departure, we quickly packed our things and went on the Jul 18, 2018 to the airport in Hamburg, Germany.
This journey was our dream for one year and then it finally started!

## The flight
At 2:50pm the plane from Hamburg to Keflavik started.
We flew with IcelandAir which was more expensive then low-price-airlines, but also more relaxing.
At 3:15pm our plane landed in Keflavik where a Bus brought us to the terminal.

One backpack came very quickly at the luggage belts but the second didn't come.
After a lot of irritated searching we found it at the **bulky luggage**, which was just a big door with some luggage in front of it.
In the middle of this pile of luggage was our second backpack.

After collecting all our stuff, we went to the customs, because Island we had more than 3kg of food which needs to be declared to the customs.
We were the only ones there and -- in true german manner -- took a ticket.
The custom officer watched us and said "oh just come over".
Our conversation with the officer looked something like this:

He: "So, what do you have?"<br>
We: "We have food to declare."<br>
He: "Interesting, Carry on ..."<br>
We: "Mainly nuts, dried trekking food ..."<br>
He: "Anything else?"<br>
We: "Hm ... dried fruits ..."<br>
He: "That's it?"<br>
We: "Yeah, that's it."<br>
He: "I'm not interested, just have a nice day." (smiling)

Our theory: As long as you don't bring milk or meet products with you the paperwork is more expensive than the customs duties.

## Arrival in Reykjavik
We used the FlyBus from Reykjavik, which is a bus line specially made for travelers from the airport.
FlyBus sais the buses depart 30-45 minutes after a plane arrived.
Because we took longer in the airport we were a bit late, but for us (at 4pm) it looked like buses depart every 15 to 30 minutes.

The bus trip took us about 45 minutes and we were able to gather first impressions, which raised our pre-joy a lot.

In Reykjavik we arrived at the BSI, the central bus terminal.
Directly at the BSI there's a N1 gas station where we planned to buy white spirit for our camping cooker.
Because we weren't familiar with Icelandic terms (definitely know basic vocabulary and product names!) and there were multiple possible bottles, we asked a seller.
He advised us to buy "Grill Vökni" and we bought three bottles (642ISK/approx. 6$ per bottle).
Later it became clear that this might be lamp oil.
So don't buy "Grill Vökni" for a camping cooker!

## Shopping in the town
We went motivated, very happy and with our 30kg heavy backpack to the city center.
Uphill.
Reykjavik is not located on a mountain but on a hill, which however felt like a mountain.
When we arrived at the top we walked pass the Hallgrimskirkja to the shopping zone where walked through masses of tourists to a Bonus-supermarket.
Iceland is known for hiking and outdoor activities but we were clear outsider with our big backpacks.

At the supermarket we bought Parmesan (598ISK/approx. 5,70$), Gouda (889ISK/approx. 8,50$) and two bottles of a cider softdrink (1.5L each 198ISK/1,90$).
Softdrinks are not that expensive in comparison to food.

In front of the supermarket we met an elderly woman with her dog.
There was also a cat always walking besides the dog but the cat doesn't belong to her, however the dog and cat were good friends.
We had a little chat and then went to the campsite.

## Campsite in Reykjavik
There're also bus lines you can take but Reykjavik is not that large and we walked the whole way.
Even though we carried 30kg on our backs, it was totally doable.
One part of the way lead us along the waterside and was very pretty, even though there was some rain.

The campsite is directly located next to a big swimming bath and was pretty large.
Next to tents there're also caravans and campers.
The reception is in a house where also a communal kitchen and a small shop is located.
In front of the reception are benches, tables and also the showers, toilets and big garbage containers.
Everything looked nice and clean.

The price was -- for us Germans -- pretty expensive: One night for two persons in one tent costs about 4800ISK (approx. 45,70$).

## Buying white spirit (second attempt)
After building up our tent on the rather full meadow and preparing our first trekking meal, we noticed that the "white spirit" be bought wasn't working.
At that time we didn't know that we bought lamp oil so we trot a bit confused to the reception to get some help.

A helpful lady at the reception cleared the situation and told us that be bought lamp oil.
She even called the N1 gas station and asked if we could return the bottles.
To find real white spirit, we slightly edgy and frustrated searched for another gas station and found one.
There we bought three bottles of "Coleman Bensin" (each 1790ISK/approx. 17$).
Pretty expensive but we were hungry, nervous and had to get up early on the next day.

{{< note "Actual white spirit is called **rodspirit/rödspirit**, **bensin** or also **vinandi** -- the **white spirit** we thought we bought might actually be lamp oil? ..." >}}

The stuff we bought produces a lot of soot but worked very well.
Too good to be true:
We always diluted it with a bit of water (depending on wind and temperature) so it doesn't burn that strong.
Without water the flame was to high and strong so that even the lid of the cooker was not able to extinguish it!

After the meal we tried to sleep and directly noticed that the night is far from being dark.
A small scarf, which can be used to cover your eyes, is very helpful in the Icelandic summer!
