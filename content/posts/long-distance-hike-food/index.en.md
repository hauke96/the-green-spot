When you take a look on our {{< linkTag "island-2018" "Iceland tour in 2018" >}}, you'll notice that we did a quite long hike.
Because of this long time (about three weeks without breaks) there might appear some questions.

* What can I take with me?
* What do I need?
* How much do I need?
* How often do I have to eat during the day?
* What should I consider when choosing food?
* What consequences does bad planning have?
* And also: What to do when the planning was not correct?

Most of the comments on the internet regarding our iceland tour said that we'll probably starve and that it's insane to carry so much food with us.
One of the comments directly said that we're going to die. (TODO quote?)
We had to do some compromises to make this all possible and left our every-day comfort zone.
Variety is something very valuable and very much unerestimated in our normal life.
