When you take a look on our {{< linkTag "island-2018" "Iceland tour in 2018" >}}, you'll notice that we did a quite long hike.
Because of this long time (about three weeks without breaks) there might appear some questions.

* What can I take with me?
* What do I need?
* How much do I need?
* How often do I have to eat during the day?
* What should I consider when choosing food?
* What consequences does bad planning have?
* And also: What to do when the planning was not correct?

Most of the comments on the internet regarding our iceland tour said that we'll probably starve and that it's insane to carry so much food with us.
One of the comments directly said that we're going to die. (TODO quote?)
We had to do some compromises to make this all possible and left our every-day comfort zone.
Variety is something very valuable and very much unerestimated in our normal life.

# Eat and drink enough
Our body needs **much more calories** when we're active over the whole day (about twice as much, so 4000-5000 kcal).

When temperatures are low (also at night during sleep), it's harder for our body to keep its temperature of 36/37Â°C.
This means that the body also need more energy while resting or sleeping.
Good suitable **clothing** and a warm **sleeping bag** are needed to support our body keeping its temperature.

If you don't consume enough water, salt and other minerals, the body can easily get stressed when sweating.
This however can have a negative effect on the (TODO Kreislauf) and also on the (TODO Niere).

The kind of food on such a tour differs a lot from the one of our daily life, which sadly has often a negative effect on our (TODO Verdauungssystem).
This can lead to situations from (TODO Verstopfung) to (TODO Durchfall).
A separate article regarding the "(TODO Reiseapotheke)" will probably come in the future.

## Too less food results in a bad mood
A badly filled stomach results in bad mood and more or less kills all motivation, which can lead to conflicts when hiking in groups (even when you're in a pair).
Eating is, next to sleeping, washing and clothing, one of the most basic things a human needs and is the fundament of (TODO Zufriedenheit).

When these basic things are not fully covered, it's very likely that you become unhappy over time.
The body then is stressed and is more sensible to external (TODO Reize):
The rain is more unpleasant, the hill is unnecessary steep and a conversation is the last thing you want.

## Little fun fact about stress
Stress has very negative effects on the body and you might loose the ability to control your focus.
It can even to further and you may become more sensible to pain and even wounds might heal slower.

A long distance hiking tour does definitely not have the goal to produce stress, but to collect a lot of nice impressions.
Therefore is eating one key parts of hiking needed to prevent stress.

# What food to take with you?
It depends on how long the journey is and what you like to eat.

If the journey is shorter, things like cheese and sausages probably stay fresh.
For longer trips (a week and longer), quickly perishable food is not suitable.

# Breakfast
Next to the actual food, a cup of tee (and next time instant coffee) was part of our breakfast.
The tea does not only warm up your inner body but motivates and also wakes up your immune system (depends on the tea, we had a lot of hot lemon tea).

The basis of our breakfast was porridge or crambled egg (we took the Trek 'n eat kind of meal and liked it a lot).
Normally we had 1x porridge + 1/2 BP-WR bar (sweat tasting emergency food and nearly the same as BP-5, NRG-5, NRG-M, EPA, MRE, ...).
In addition to that we mixed the porridge with some nuts (walnuts, cashews, peanuts, macadamia nuts, etc.) and dried fruits (plums, figs, dates, apricots) to have some varieties.

Generally we tried to create a breakfast sates for some time so that we didn't became hungry after a few steps.
Furthermore the breakfast should contain a lot of fibre for the digestion as well as long and short chain sugar, which gives you short and long term energy.

For us the scrambled egg was not as filling as the porridge.
In hindsight we'll experiment a bit because all the Nuts with their high concentration of fat were not that good for the digestion.
