When you take a look on our {{< linkTag "island-2018" "Iceland tour in 2018" >}}, you'll notice that we did a quite long hike.
Because of this long time (about three weeks without breaks) there might appear some questions.

* What can I take with me?
* What do I need?
* How much do I need?
* How often do I have to eat during the day?
* What should I consider when choosing food?
* What consequences does bad planning have?
* And also: What to do when the planning was not correct?

Most of the comments on the internet regarding our iceland tour said that we'll probably starve and that it's insane to carry so much food with us.
One of the comments directly said that we're going to die. (TODO quote?)
We had to do some compromises to make this all possible and left our every-day comfort zone.
Variety is something very valuable and very much unerestimated in our normal life.

# Eat and drink enough
Our body needs **much more calories** when we're active over the whole day (about twice as much, so 4000-5000 kcal).

When temperatures are low (also at night during sleep), it's harder for our body to keep its temperature of 36/37Â°C.
This means that the body also need more energy while resting or sleeping.
Good suitable **clothing** and a warm **sleeping bag** are needed to support our body keeping its temperature.

If you don't consume enough water, salt and other minerals, the body can easily get stressed when sweating.
This however can have a negative effect on the (TODO Kreislauf) and also on the (TODO Niere).

The kind of food on such a tour differs a lot from the one of our daily life, which sadly has often a negative effect on our (TODO Verdauungssystem).
This can lead to situations from (TODO Verstopfung) to (TODO Durchfall).
A separate article regarding the "(TODO Reiseapotheke)" will probably come in the future.
