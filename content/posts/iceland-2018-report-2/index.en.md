The day before, we followed the Laugavegur and slept at the Fremri-Emstrua near the Bildufell.

# Day 4: Bildufell → Innri-Emstrua
{{< smallDate "2018-07-21" >}}

Because we haven't made it that far the day before, we wanted to hurry up a bit.
We stood up quite early because out hiking map showed that a larger ascend/climb was ahead:
First 100m at once and then another 100m.
All in all ca. 200m doesn't sound that much, but it turned out to be steep and rough.

## Cleaning day
Right before the first ascend, we found a small but beautiful waterfall.
Because we wore our clothes for a few days now, we decided to take a break and wash us and our clothes.

There were even more waterfalls further along the cliff, but this one was the nearest and most beautiful one.
The water was unbelievable cold, nevertheless it was a good feeling to be clean and put on a fresh shirt and socks.

We tied our wet clothes onto our backpacks in the hope, that they might dry a bit.
Unfortunately it was slightly raining.
