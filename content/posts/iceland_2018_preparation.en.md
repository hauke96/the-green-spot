Before we talk about or {{< linkTag iceland-2018 "Iceland hike in 2018" >}}, we present the things we considered while preparing our journey.

A long time ago, we decided to travel to Iceland. Finally, on the 18th of July in 2018, we went into the plane, but a lot of things had to happen until then.

This will be some kind of FAQ with some information, hints and experiences to prepare yourself.

# Key information

# Planning key details
First we clarified the most basic information:

* When?
* How long?
* What to we want to see?

We could easily answer these questions, because holiday and budget were two important factors. We decided to use our whole holidays to be there from the 18th of July until the 10th of August (that are 24 days). Originally we wanted to start at the 20th/21st but the flight on the 18th was cheaper.

We roughly decided what we want to see. Definitely a hot spring, black desert and many green mountains.

After that, we clarified some details:

* In what region?
* How to get there?
* What route to choose?

We had to do some research to answer these questions, especially as we didn't know Iceland.

## Find the right region
We just looked on **Google Maps** and found places we like. Some places were fixed (e.g. Langisjór or Mælifell), because we saw them earlier on the internet and absolutely wanted to see them.

We learned that there are areas, that are **nearly not mapped** at all. For example aren't there any information for the route from Langisjór to Landmannalaugar, no information about the conditions, no photos and only a few trip reports. Later we thought about alternative routes, to get rid of this uncertainty.

The final route started in Þórsmörk and went to Landmannalaugar. More about the route in the separate travel reports.

## Arrival and departure
One thing was clear: We'll go there by plain. But then?

The first night will be in Reykjavík on the campsite, but we didn't know how to get there. We searched a lot and always thought about alternatives. In the end we planned the following:

We wanted to take the **FlyBus** from Keflavík to Reykjavík (BSÍ), then go shopping and in the evening go to the campsite (you can definitely walk the distance and you see something from Reykjavík).

For the trip to the highlands (and back) we booked tickets at **Reykjavík Excursions**, it was the most comfortable choice. Depending on the route there might be a better provider, but for us it was fine.

The FlyBus should also take us back to the airport and we planned to have some connection time at the BSÍ.

There will probably be a separate article about the transport.

# Source of information
We primarily got our information from friends and forums in the internet. There are also books and other sources for information and advices, but we haven't bought any books or such.

We read a lot of articles like this. They were more or less helpful but as soon as we found photos of difficult/critical points (e.g. a ford), they helped us during the planing of our route.

On **YouTube** there are a lot of videos of iceland, which is very helpful because you can see how deep a ford is or how the landscape actually looks like. There are also e.g. [timelapse videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvdSu42BsCk), which give a good impression on the landscape, roads, weather and ground conditions.

Furthermore there's also [reddit](https://reddit.com) where several subreddits (some kind of sub-category) exist about [ultra light](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/), [visiting iceland](https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/) und [hiking](https://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/) in general. We also used **classical forums** like the german [outdoorseiten.de](https://www.outdoorseiten.net/forum/). Those good old forums are the most helpful source of information and there are also a lot of good english forums.

## Don't get confused by feedback
Critique is always a problematic thing: There's good and bad critisism.

Some people are giving you good critique, showing alternatives or talk abut their experiences. Other people only say that your plan is absolutely stupid and don't offer a better solution.

Dont't be confused or demotivated by such bad critisism, just **collect other peoples thoughts** and decide on your own what you change on your plan. Don't rely blindly on other people!

## Our experience with critisism in the internet
It was not our intention to do an easy-peasy hike in iceland. Many people see a hike (or maybe also trekking) as a kind of easy walk and discouraged us from doing such a journey as we planed it (you'll see the reason for that in later reports).

When looking back, many people were'nt right. There was a lot of good and helpful feedback but we didn't followed a lot of advises and made compromises.

For example: Everybody discouraged us from taking 30kg of food for the 24 days with us. But we did it, it wasn't easy but it worked.
