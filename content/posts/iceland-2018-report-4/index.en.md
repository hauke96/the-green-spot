# Tag 13: Sveinstindur emergency shelter → Langisjór
{{< smallDate "2018-07-30" >}}

Made a nice breakfast in the hut, which was very nice, small, old but cosy.
On the wall there was a map of the Langisjór from 1959.

Shortly after 12pm we started our way to the Langisjór lake.
On our way we found the actual Sveinstindur hut, which is marked on our hiking map and which we originally wanted to reach.
Again it was a Útivist hut which was rented to a group of people so that we weren't able to sleep there anyway.

After a quite steep and windy ascend onto a mountain ridge next to the hut, we soon reached the Langisjór.
We walked the last bit on a track "Sveinstindur" which was parallel to the F-235.

There was a large parking space and a campsite, which was closed at that time so that we weren't able to book any space there.
Besides the campsite was unbelievably ugly, just an area of gravel next to the parking space.
No trees, no bushes, nothing but the campsite hut and gravel.

On a promontory within the Langisjór, there was another hut and we had the hope to sleep there.
After visiting a nice viewing point, we went to that hut and discovered that it was closed and locked.
It wasn't a Útivist but a private one you can rent.

It was also very cold and windy so that we weren't able to build up our tent (6°C/43°F, rain and hurricane-like gusts).
We thought of building up our tent in the wind shadow of the hut but suddenly a jeep drove towards us and a french tourist family arrived which rented the hut.

We asked them if it would be okay if we camp on their porch but the father of the family directly invited us to come in and offered us the couch to sleep on.
The hut had a small sleeping room with four beds and one sleeping-couch in the living room.
Because it was a family of five, the father and mother shared one of the small beds so that Kristina and I were able sleep on the couch.
People could not be more hospitable, unbelievably nice!

It was the last day of their vacation so they had enough food so that they also made dinner for us as well.
Rice with some spicy pesto.
Quite simply but after 13 days of tracking meals and mashed potatoes like a feast for us.
After dinner we played some cards and had a nice conversation.

The hut even has a gas heating so that it was nice warm and cosy and we directly fell asleep.

# Day 14: Langisjór → Lónakvísl
{{< smallDate "2018-07-31" >}}

The night was awesome.
Sleeping in a real bed (even if it's a sleeping couch) is pure luxury.

We ate our usual porridge for breakfast, which was unusual for the family because we both crumbled one BP-WR bar into it.
In addition to that, we both also put nuts and dried fruits into it and I also added coconut flakes.
The family had some YumYum instant noodles as breakfast.

They also gave us some leftover supplies like tea and German alphabet soup with Icelandic label glued onto it.
It was even better that they took our garbage bag with them, because it had some serious weight and started to smell.

We then said good bye, they left to Keflavík and we stepped through wind and rain towards Faxasund.
We never experienced such a lovely encounter before, unbelievable!

Our mood was good and we considered the starting second half of our hike as the way back.
The weather suddenly became better as we passed the mountain ridge between Hrútabjörg and Grænifjallgarður heading for the Tungnaá.
Note: Mountain ridges are sometimes like weather borders.

{{< imgScale "DSC00948_1600.JPG" "Still slightly misty and a bit of rain on the horizon but nevertheless some awesome landscape." "500x" >}}

The landscape was beautiful in its typical Icelandic way: Black sand and endless expense.
Our goal for this day was a lake near the river Lonakvisl where another hut was located on our hiking map.

On a hill we had a good view over the landscape and were even seeing the hut on the lake.
The descend was a bit adventurous (the slope was very steep) and we had to cross a smaller stream.

Unfortunately was the hut a private one but also not rented to someone so that we just pitched up our tent next to the hut.
Because it wasn't too late, we were able to relax and watch the beautiful sunset.
