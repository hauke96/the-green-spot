# What is this place?
You landed on the blog *The green spot* where we write stories and reports about trekking, but trekking of a different kind. We write about our tours and things that come to our mind.

When you hear the word *we*, Kristina and Hauke (we're both from Germany) are ment. We both love trekking, preferably in regions where nobody else is, with gear, nobody else wants to carry. Comfortable huts, campsites or event hotels are foreign to us.

# The special thing about this blog
Many people go trekking/hiking, which is good, because it makes fun and you'll always experience great things. Most of the people, however, use (well known) hiking trails, which is not the case with us. We love to go off-road ... or off-trail.

Too dangerous for others, a welcome adventure for us ;)

# About the name
We thought long about a name and came up with *The green spot*, because there two meanings in there: First is our tent bright green and second, there're lots of green spots in the world we (want/will) travel to.
