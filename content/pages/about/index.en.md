Welcome to _The green spot_, a blog about trekking, always trying to be where no civilization is.

## Who is writing here?
Most of the time it's me: Hauke, software developer from Hamburg, Germany.
I love trekking, preferably in regions where nobody else is, with gear, nobody else wants to carry.
Comfortable huts, campsites or event hotels are foreign to me.

## The special thing about this blog
Many people go trekking/hiking, which is good, because it makes fun and you'll always experience great things.
Most of the people, however, use (well known) hiking trails, which is not the case with me.
I love to go off-road ... or off-trail.

Too dangerous for others, but - with proper preparations - a welcome adventure for me ;)

## About the name
I thought long about a name and came up with *The green spot*, because there are two meanings in there:
First is my tent bright green and second, there are a lot of green spots in the world to discover.
